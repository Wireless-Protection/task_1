# Evil Twin attack:
An evil twin attack is a spoofing cyberattack that works by tricking users into connecting to a fake Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate network. Once a user is connected to an “evil twin” network, hackers can access everything from their network traffic to private login credentials.

## How an Evil Twin Attack Works

The most dangerous evil twin attacks work by tricking victims into thinking that they are connecting to a reliable public Wi-Fi network. To make the attack as believable as possible, hackers typically use the following steps:

### Step 1: Choosing a location with free Wi-Fi

Hackers choose a busy location with free, popular Wi-Fi like an airport, library or coffee shop to execute their attack. These places often have multiple access points with the same name, making it easier for a hacker’s fake network to go unnoticed.

### Step 2: Setting up a Wi-Fi access point

Next, the hacker creates a new hotspot using the same Service Set Identifier (SSID) name as the legitimate network. They can use almost any device to do this, including phones, laptops, portable routers and tablets. Some hackers may even use a Wi-Fi Pineapple to achieve a broader range.

### Step 3: Creating a fake captive portal page

If you’ve ever logged into a public Wi-Fi network, you’ve probably encountered a captive portal page. These typically require you to enter a password or other basic information to access the network. While many legitimate networks use these, hackers can easily replicate them to trick users into sending over their login information. Unfortunately, it can be nearly impossible to tell the difference between a legitimate and fake captive portal page if the hacker knows what they’re doing.

### Step 4: Setting up closer to potential victims

Once a hacker has finished setting up the evil twin access point and fake captive portal page, they may move their device or router closer to potential victims to create a stronger signal. This convinces people to choose their network over the weaker ones and forces some devices to connect automatically.

### Step 5: Monitoring and stealing user data

Once a victim has connected their device to an “evil twin” network, the hacker can monitor everything they do online, from scrolling through social media accounts to checking bank statements. If a user logs into any of their accounts while connected to the network, the hacker can collect their login credentials. This is especially dangerous if the user uses the same credentials for multiple sensitive accounts.
